# READ THIS BEFORE LOOKING AT THIS CODE!

These are my solutions to [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenges, which I am doing as an exercise to get better at doing crypto CTF challenges. I am trying to do at least Set 1 in Rust, however there is a good chance that I will be switching to Python later as the challenges get harder.

To quote the website:
> For several years, we ran these challenges over email, and asked participants not to share their results. *The honor system worked beautifully!* But now we're ready to set aside the ceremony and just publish the challenges for everyone to work on. 
I am publishing these so that people can be seeing the code that I write, and potentially judging and/or giving feedback on it (This is my first time writing in Rust!).

However, **Do not read this code if you want to be figuring out these challenges for yourself!** I have found great enjoyment in doing these and figuring them out myself, and encourage you to do the same.
